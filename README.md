There are two jupyter notebooks in the repo: one for analysis of red wine data, the other for analysis of diabetes data

To run each notebook, clone the repo, create a virtual environment and install packages in `requirements.txt`, and then run the notebook using jupyter notebook (can run all cells at the top)
